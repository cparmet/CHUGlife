# CHUGlife

This web app searches one Instagram (IG) account for specific text and displays matching images and captions.

See it in action: www.chadparmet.com.

## Motivation
A pair of nature photographers, posting at [@PhotoCHUG](www.instagram.com/photochug), wanted to use our IG account as a record of the animal species we've seen and quickly retrieve that Lifelist in the field. On the IG website, I could not see how to search tags within a single IG account.

## Built with
This app uses the @midnightSuyama fantastic Instagram Explore Module. I found it friendlier than the Instagram API for queries on a public IG account.

It also uses Pandas and Numpy on the backend, as well as Flask, Bootstrap CSS, and a little JQuery for the web interface.
