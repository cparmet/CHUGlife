# CHUGlife
~ Using Instagram as a database with Flask ~

This web app searches one Instagram (IG) account for specific text and displays matching images and captions.

## Motivation
A pair of nature photographers, posting at @PhotoCHUG, wanted to use our IG account as a record of the animal species we've seen and quickly retrieve that Lifelist in the field.

On the IG website, I could not see how to search tags within a single IG account.

## Built with
This app uses Midnight Suyama's fantastic Instagram Explore Module:

It also uses Pandas and Numpy, as well as Flask, Bootstrap CSS, and a little JQuery for the web interface.

The animation for the Searching spinner is by Irina Mir from Dribble:
