# CHUGlife

This web app searches one Instagram (IG) account for specific text and displays matching images and captions.

See it in action: www.chadparmet.com.

## Motivation
A pair of nature photographers, posting at [@PhotoCHUG](www.instagram.com/photochug), wanted to use our IG account as a record of the animal species we've seen and quickly retrieve that Lifelist in the field. The IG website doesn't allow users to search for a hashtag filtered to a single account.

## Built with
This app uses the fantastic [Instagram Explore Module](https://github.com/midnightSuyama/instagram-explore) by @midnightSuyama. I found it friendlier than the Instagram API for queries on a public IG account.

It also uses Pandas and Numpy on the backend, as well as Flask, Bootstrap CSS, and a little JQuery for the web interface.

The owl when searching is by the super talented [Irina Mir](https://dribbble.com/shots/3053961-Owl-head-spin), used with kind permission.
