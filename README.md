# CHUGlife
~ Using Instagram as a database with Flask ~

This web app searches one Instagram (IG) account for specific text matches and displays matching images and captions. It lets two nature photographers, @PhotoCHUG, to use our IG account as a record of animal species we've seen and quickly retrieve them in the field.

## Motivation
On the IG website, I could not see how to search tags within a single IG account. 

## Built with
This app uses Midnight Suyama's fantastic Instagram Explore Module:

It also uses Pandas and Numpy, as well as Flask, Bootstrap CSS, and a little JQuery for the web interface.
