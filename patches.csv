20481801_162824957612664_6845457019692908544_n.jpg	"To continue the theme of birds eating sparrows in my mulberry tree, here's a trio of shots from last year. This Blue Jay swooped in on this poor, small sparrow. The rest of the sparrows went crazy, chirping and squawking, but he didn't pay them any mind. Just kept eating. Started with the neck. This is the first Photochug post that might be rated R. But that's just nature's way... Scroll through the pix fast to see the action. photochug#bluejay #jay #photochug #Audubon #birds #orinthology #massaudubon #dug #brooklinebirds #RIPsparrow"

In the first picture, you can see the body of the deceased sparrow next to the owl. In the second, you see a sparrow feather in his beak. The third shows the eyes of a stone cold killer. photochug#owl #screechowl #easternscreechowl #photochug #Audubon #massaudubon #birds #orinthology #brooklinebirds #RIPsparrow #dug"
